## Abstract

Self-improving agents seek to reduce the human engineering effort behind AI systems by enabling them to evolve and self-improve their performance over time. Recently, methods like the Darwin Gödel Machine and the Huxley Gödel Machine have been proposed which enable open-ended, recursive self-improvement through self-reference where a coding agent edits its own code. Such self-referential self-improvement methods require that the competence required to perform the task coincides or aligns well with the competence required for self-modification which is the case for coding tasks. For domains or tasks, which do not satisfy the alignment needed, self-referential self-improvement is not available. In such cases, it is possible to adapt the above algorithms to other tasks by removing the self-referential aspect or introducing explicit self-modification of a meta-agent -- both computationally expensive, relying on population or self-modification search over many candidate agents. For planning tasks with explicit constraints, we propose a far cheaper alternative. We introduce SBCO (Self-supervised Block Coordinate Optimizer), a verifier-grounded harness optimizer in the same closed-loop, improve-from-experience family as the Gödel-machine methods, but self-supervised rather than self-referential. Given an agentic harness, SBCO learns a decomposed bank of verifiers and a harness policy via approximate block coordinate ascent, improving the agent's outputs from its own graded feedback---with a fixed meta-agent and no human labels. Across two domains SBCO matches or exceeds a customized self-modifying baseline while using 4-5.5 times less compute budget.
